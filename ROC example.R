# create data --
#    the response is what we want to predict (e.g., actual sentiment); in this
#       example there are 3 values (1,2, and 3)
#    x is the predictor (e.g., the sentiment score)

response <- kronecker(1:3, rep(1,5))

# plot the data -- note that the lower the 'x' value,
#    the lower the response. The prediction is almost
#    perfect, except for x = 10, which has response = 1;
#    otherwise, response 1 has x values between 1 - 5,
#    response 2 has x values between 6 - 10, etc

# Note that perfect prediction is 1; in this case, multiclass AUC is 0.94
